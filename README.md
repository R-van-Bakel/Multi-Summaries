# lod_summarization
This project contains code for the summarizing a lot of linked open data.
Run `set_up_and_run.sh` to compile the C++ files and test them on the `Laurence_Fishburne_Custom_Shuffled.trig` data.
For this to work, the `BOOST_HOME` variable, in `set_up_and_run.sh` should be set to the location of your boost installation.
